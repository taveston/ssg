# Findings

Observations from building and playing the prototype, in two sections. **To triage** holds findings waiting for a decision at the next design session. **Parked** holds findings that can't be decided until a later feature is designed, each with a line saying what brings it back. Once a finding is settled, the outcome goes into the spec, the code or the to-do list, and the finding is deleted.

Format and types are in `docs/README.md`. New findings go under To triage and take the next free number from F-174.

## To triage

### F-162 · Which band Iver Yard sits in
- **Observation:** SCL-07 now puts every station in a band, so the build drops a station's own orbit. TEST-02 and TEST-09 name the band for Arden Highport and Tern Relay, but nothing names one for Iver Yard, which had its own 45,000 km orbit. The build puts it in Iver's High band (197,200 km at 34 radii, period about 10.6 d). That band was nearest its old orbit when High was 10 radii; now the Low band (6,300 km) is nearer. This moves Iver's satellite frame out to 197,200 km.
- **Affects:** SCL-07, TEST-01 · **Type:** spec gap
- **Disposition:** open. Accept, or name Iver Yard's band in TEST-01.

### F-163 · Vestige's burn time is longer than the orbit it leaves
- **Observation:** Vestige's first burn from Earth's Low band to its High band (SOL-17) is about 3.0 km/s at 20 milli-g, so XFER-05 gives it 4.2 h of burn days. Against the 52 h Hohmann crossing that is a small share. The rule keeps the ship Parked in Low for those 4.2 h, then applies the whole burn as one impulse at the crossing start, and solves the crossing again from that later start. So the burn only delays the trip: no thrust arc is drawn, no gravity loss is charged, and the time the ship would spend burning is spent waiting. Yet 4.2 h is about 2.7 laps of Low (94.5 min), so a real burn that long could not be treated as an impulse at one point. Marlin's burn (0.1 g, about 51 min) is about half a lap, which is borderline too.
- **Affects:** XFER-05, SOL-16, SOL-17 · **Type:** spec gap
- **Disposition:** open. Accept the delay as a stand-in, or say how a burn that lasts a large share of an orbit is modelled (bears on F-158).

### F-164 · How the selection mark moves while a satellite folds
- **Observation:** HOV-06 says a marker part-way folded or faded has a mark faded by the same alpha, and INS-06 says the mark moves from the pill to the marker without a jump. The build follows INS-06 for the fold: the mark keeps its full strength and its box slides between the pill's box and the marker's as the satellite slides (`fold_unfold_anim_ms`). The fade by the marker's alpha is applied only to the dot fading into its exposure ring (MOT-11). When a parent's last folded satellite unfolds, its pill hides at once, so that mark starts from the parent's marker instead of the pill.
- **Affects:** HOV-06, INS-06, GRP-03 · **Type:** spec gap
- **Disposition:** open. Accept, or say whether the mark should fade with the fold slide.

### F-165 · What a shared orbit's identity pill brackets for
- **Observation:** HOV-05 brackets a shared orbit's identity pill while the orbit is hovered. HOV-06 puts an object's mark on its exposure ring's identity mark, and a member of a shared orbit has the pill as its mark. The build gives the pill the selection mark while any member is selected, and the hover mark while the orbit or any member is hovered (for example, from the outline).
- **Affects:** HOV-05, HOV-06, MOT-14 · **Type:** spec gap
- **Disposition:** open. Accept, or say which objects the pill stands for.

### F-166 · Labels sit very close to the brackets
- **Observation:** Seen on screen. LBL-01 measures `label_gap_px` (6 px) from the marker's edge, and the bracket box reaches `bracket_margin_px` (4 px) beyond it. A selected or hovered object's label starts 2 px outside its brackets, and at the system fit the right-hand arms nearly touch Halden IV's first letter. The build leaves label placement as it was.
- **Affects:** LBL-01, HOV-06, HOV-07 · **Type:** spec wrong
- **Disposition:** open. Options: measure the label gap from the bracket box (for every marker, so labels don't move on hover), or raise `label_gap_px`.

### F-167 · Where the condition bar sits, and what an empty bar looks like
- **Observation:** SYM-12 puts the bar "under the frame" but gives no gap. Directly under the frame, the selection and hover brackets (HOV-07, 4 px clear of the frame) would cross it. The build starts the bar 1 px below the bracket box, so 5 px below the frame. The spec doesn't say how the unfilled part looks either. The build draws it in the bar's colour mixed 25 % into the ground, so a part-full bar shows its whole length. An own ship with no known condition (Corvane's own-flag civilians) has no bar.
- **Affects:** SYM-12, HOV-07 · **Type:** spec gap
- **Disposition:** open. Accept, or give the gap and the empty part's look.

### F-168 · Capture and closest approach inside the primary's frame
- **Observation:** BAND-06 and PHAS-11 read the point from the hyperbola a ship arrives on from outside a body's frame. A crossing round the body itself (band to band, or to a gate round the star) has no such hyperbola: its arc ends at a real place. The build lands a Rendezvous where the arc ends, and gives an Intercept there the angle of the arc's end as its closest-approach phase. The old rule (the angle of the arrival velocity) put the ship somewhere it never flew.
- **Affects:** BAND-06, PHAS-11 · **Type:** spec gap
- **Disposition:** open. Accept, and say so in BAND-06.

### F-169 · "Already there" is a reason to the planner and done at once to an order
- **Observation:** PHAS-04 says the plan is Done at once, and PLNR-42 and PLNR-92 make "Already there" a reason the solver gives. The build does both: the solver (`preview`) returns `AlreadyThere`, and `schedule` accepts the order and changes nothing, as Hold does for a parked ship. No Done plan is kept on the ship.
- **Affects:** PHAS-04, PLNR-42 · **Type:** spec gap
- **Disposition:** open. Accept, or say whether a Done plan should be recorded.

### F-170 · How a low-thrust Intercept is trimmed
- **Observation:** PHAS-15 trims an Intercept by lengthening `travel_days`, but a low-thrust drive's travel time is fixed by the drive (XFER-06). The build adds the trim to the spiral's length: same delta-v, gentler thrust, ending at the body a little later. Separately, the trim can fail on an impulsive leg when a small change of travel time moves the exit point past the ship, so the departure wait (PHAS-03) jumps by a period; the leg is then "Can't line up".
- **Affects:** PHAS-15, XFER-06, PHAS-03 · **Type:** spec gap
- **Disposition:** open. Accept, make a low-thrust Intercept at a station infeasible, or trim it by waiting before departure.

### F-171 · Which band an Intercept at a station passes through
- **Observation:** XFER-10 says an Intercept at a station or parked ship takes the target's band, but the order also carries `Intercept { band }`. The build uses the target's band and ignores the order's, so an Intercept at a station in a Low band (Arden Highport) passes through Low and is turned (XFER-13). Its speed (XFER-09) is taken at the target's band; for a station round the crossing's primary it is the plain relative speed (XFER-10).
- **Affects:** XFER-10, XFER-08, XFER-09 · **Type:** spec gap
- **Disposition:** open. Accept, or say what the order's band means for a station.

### F-172 · The phasing rule of thumb holds only near half a turn
- **Observation:** PHAS-13's rule of thumb (delta-v × meeting time within 3% of ⅔ × r × angle, for k ≥ 2) holds for the half-turn gap the check gives. For other gaps it can miss: at a gap of 0.8 of a turn, k = 2, inner orbit, it is 3.1% off. The test checks the half-turn case only.
- **Affects:** PHAS-13 · **Type:** spec wrong
- **Disposition:** open. Limit the rule to the half-turn case, or widen the tolerance.

### F-173 · Groups are together, but nothing forms them yet
- **Observation:** PHAS-14 needs the ships of a group to be together, but nothing in play forms a group (F-159). The build adds the check only: `SystemTree::all_together` says whether ships could be one group (all parked in one orbit, every two together). Whatever forms or merges groups should call it. The departure wait, the arrival wait and docking all read phase, so ships that are together leave and arrive together.
- **Affects:** PHAS-14 · **Type:** spec gap
- **Disposition:** open. Use the check when group orders are specced.

### F-180 · A pass through a moon's Low band from beyond its planet
- **Observation:** A crossing from another planet to a moon goes round the star and aims at the moon's planet (XFER-01). An Intercept through the moon's Low band then turns by the moon's gravity, but at the planet's position and with the velocity relative to the planet, which is what the crossing ends on. The closest-approach phase (PHAS-11) already reads the same way. The build accepts this.
- **Affects:** XFER-13, XFER-01 · **Type:** spec gap
- **Disposition:** open. Accept, or say how a pass through a moon's band is aimed from outside its planet's frame.

### F-181 · A low-thrust pass through Low reads as half a turn
- **Observation:** A low-thrust crossing ends on the body's circle at almost the body's own velocity (XFER-06), so it arrives with almost no excess speed. XFER-13 then gives a turn of nearly 180°, though turning an excess velocity that small changes almost nothing. The build applies the rule as written, so the planner's label (PLNR-65) would read "turn 180°".
- **Affects:** XFER-13, XFER-06, PLNR-65 · **Type:** spec gap
- **Disposition:** open. Accept, show no turn for a low-thrust leg, or make a low-thrust Intercept through Low infeasible.

## Parked

### F-145 · An intercept needs a standoff distance
- **Observation:** Raised in a combat design session. XFER-10 ends a ship-as-destination crossing at the target's position on the crossing end day, so an Intercept is a collision course with zero miss distance. A real engagement has a chosen miss distance, and it sets how long each side is in weapon range and which weapons can act. The order has no way to carry one. An Intercept at a station is trimmed to meet it (PHAS-15), so it too has zero miss distance.
- **Affects:** XFER-08, XFER-09, XFER-10, PHAS-15 · **Type:** spec gap
- **Disposition:** parked. Option: a `standoff_km` on an Intercept whose destination is a ship, so the crossing ends offset from the target's rail rather than on it. A Rendezvous keeps zero. What the standoff should default to, and how the resolver reads it, are for the conflict doc to settle.
- **Revisit when:** the combat design is specced. The default is an open question in `docs/ideas/mechanics/conflict.md`.

### F-158 · Departure and capture costs add up to far more than a real trip
- **Observation:** Raised while sizing Marlin for Sol (SOL-15). BAND-03 and XFER-04 charge a ship the cost of escaping its band to rest at infinity, then the burn that sets its speed round the primary, and the same again at the far end. A real burn deep in a gravity well does both at once and is much cheaper (the Oberth effect). From Earth's Low band to a Low band at the target, with a Hohmann crossing, the spec's cost against a patched-conic figure for the same bands: Venus 11.3 against 6.7 km/s, Mars 10.1 against 5.6, Ceres 14.4 against 9.5, Mercury 21.4 against 13.2. The spec is 1.5 to 1.8 times too high. The low-thrust crossing (XFER-06) adds the same escape cost, which for a spiral is too low: a spiral escape costs the full circular speed, not √2 − 1 of it.
- **Affects:** BAND-03, XFER-04, XFER-06, XFER-12, SOL-15 · **Type:** spec wrong
- **Disposition:** parked. The model needs fixing, and the fix is a significant piece of work, so the spec and the build stay as they are for now (decided 2026-10-16). Option: for an impulsive drive, replace departure cost + burn 1 (and burn 2 + capture cost) with one burn from the band's circular orbit to a hyperbola with the crossing's excess speed, √(*v∞*² + 2μ/*r*) − √(μ/*r*). The excess speed is already computed for BAND-06, XFER-09 and PHAS-03. Open: how burn days (XFER-05) and approach days (BAND-04) fit, what the spiral should cost, and new figures for the XFER-12 worked checks. Marlin's delta-v would then be set again.
- **Revisit when:** the transfer-cost rework is scheduled. `docs/ideas/mechanics/transfers.md` (section 2.1) holds the lean.

### F-159 · Groups are only loosely defined
- **Observation:** SYM-09 draws a group, but nothing says what selecting one shows. The inset (INS-02) has no form for a group. The outline (INS-05) lists a group by name and count (GRP-09), with no way to list its members or reach one by one, for their Delta-v and Drive (PLNR-05). "Commander" means a person in SYM-09 and in mock-up 7 ("Cdr Ilse Marr"), but "command" means the faction giving orders in SYM-03. How groups form, merge and split is not specced either: no order creates a group, and merge and detach orders are not specced (PHAS-14). So groups exist only as test content (TEST-06) for now. The planner already refuses them (PLNR-01, PLNR-11). The combat ideas (candidate) detach and rejoin ships and call every group a force, which would be the first source of groups in play.
- **Affects:** SYM-09, SYM-10, INS-02, INS-05, GRP-09, PLNR-01, PLNR-05 · **Type:** spec gap
- **Disposition:** parked. Safe to defer: the player can't form groups yet. Specify the group inset, member access and the meaning of "commander" together with the orders that form and split groups.
- **Revisit when:** the orders that form and split groups are designed, or a group first appears in play.
