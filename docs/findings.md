# Findings

Observations from building and playing the prototype, in two sections. **To triage** holds findings waiting for a decision at the next design session. **Parked** holds findings that can't be decided until a later feature is designed, each with a line saying what brings it back. Once a finding is settled, the outcome goes into the spec, the code or the to-do list, and the finding is deleted.

Format and types are in `docs/README.md`. New findings go under To triage and take the next free number from F-162.

### F-145 · An intercept needs a standoff distance
- **Observation:** Raised in a combat design session. XFER-10 ends a ship-as-destination crossing at the target's position on the crossing end day, so an Intercept is a collision course with zero miss distance. A real engagement has a chosen miss distance, and it sets how long each side is in weapon range and which weapons can act. The order has no way to carry one. An Intercept at a station is trimmed to meet it (PHAS-15), so it too has zero miss distance.
- **Affects:** XFER-08, XFER-09, XFER-10, PHAS-15 · **Type:** spec gap
- **Disposition:** parked. Option: a `standoff_km` on an Intercept whose destination is a ship, so the crossing ends offset from the target's rail rather than on it. A Rendezvous keeps zero. What the standoff should default to, and how the resolver reads it, are for the conflict doc to settle.
- **Revisit when:** the combat design is specced. The default is an open question in `docs/ideas/mechanics/conflict.md`.

### F-158 · Departure and capture costs add up to far more than a real trip
- **Observation:** Raised while sizing Marlin for Sol (SOL-15). BAND-03 and XFER-04 charge a ship the cost of escaping its band to rest at infinity, then the burn that sets its speed round the primary, and the same again at the far end. A real burn deep in a gravity well does both at once and is much cheaper (the Oberth effect). From Earth's Low band to a Low band at the target, with a Hohmann crossing, the spec's cost against a patched-conic figure for the same bands: Venus 11.3 against 6.7 km/s, Mars 10.1 against 5.6, Ceres 14.4 against 9.5, Mercury 21.4 against 13.2. The spec is 1.5 to 1.8 times too high. The low-thrust crossing (XFER-06) adds the same escape cost, which for a spiral is too low: a spiral escape costs the full circular speed, not √2 − 1 of it.
- **Affects:** BAND-03, XFER-04, XFER-06, XFER-12, SOL-15 · **Type:** spec wrong
- **Disposition:** parked. The model needs fixing, and the fix is a significant piece of work, so the spec and the build stay as they are for now (decided 2026-10-16). Option: for an impulsive drive, replace departure cost + burn 1 (and burn 2 + capture cost) with one burn from the band's circular orbit to a hyperbola with the crossing's excess speed, √(*v∞*² + 2μ/*r*) − √(μ/*r*). The excess speed is already computed for BAND-06, XFER-09 and PHAS-03. Open: how burn days (XFER-05) and approach days (BAND-04) fit, what the spiral should cost, and new figures for the XFER-12 worked checks. Marlin's delta-v would then be set again.
- **Revisit when:** the transfer-cost rework is scheduled. `docs/ideas/mechanics/transfers.md` (section 2.1) holds the lean.

### F-159 · Groups are only loosely defined
- **Observation:** SYM-09 draws a group, but nothing says what selecting one shows. The inset (INS-02) has no form for a group. The outline (INS-05) lists a group by name and count (GRP-09), with no way to list its members or reach one by one, for their Delta-v and Drive (PLNR-05). "Commander" means a person in SYM-09 and in mock-up 7 ("Cdr Ilse Marr"), but "command" means the faction giving orders in SYM-03. How groups form, merge and split is not specced either: no order creates a group, and merge and detach orders are not specced (PHAS-14). So groups exist only as test content (TEST-06) for now. The planner already refuses them (PLNR-01, PLNR-11). The combat ideas (candidate) detach and rejoin ships and call every group a force, which would be the first source of groups in play.
- **Affects:** SYM-09, SYM-10, INS-02, INS-05, GRP-09, PLNR-01, PLNR-05 · **Type:** spec gap
- **Disposition:** parked. Safe to defer: the player can't form groups yet. Specify the group inset, member access and the meaning of "commander" together with the orders that form and split groups.
- **Revisit when:** the orders that form and split groups are designed, or a group first appears in play.
