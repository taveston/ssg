# To do

Work waiting to be built. You choose which items a coding session takes, and the order of the list is the priority.

- **Spec changes:** design sessions add an item whenever they add, change or withdraw requirements. One item per coherent change, naming the IDs.
- **Fixes:** findings triaged as "fix code".
- **Other:** refactors, tooling and doc work that isn't a spec change.

A finished item is deleted (git history keeps the record). Notes indented under an item are hints for whoever builds it.

## Spec changes

- [ ] **Ship groups and condition** · SYM-09, SYM-10, SYM-12, GRP-09, TEST-06
  - The symbols are built; groups add to them (`view/symbols.rs`, `symbol_draw.rs`).
- [ ] **Velocity leaders** · SYM-11
  - Blocked: ships in transit are simulated (`src/sim/transfer/`) but drawing them is not specced.
- [ ] **Ideology profile** · IDEO-01 to IDEO-31
  - Decide the open points in `docs/spec/ideology.md` first.
- [ ] **Sol test system** · SOL-01 to SOL-11, SOL-22 to SOL-23
  - New `src/content/sol.rs` beside `corvane.rs`. The `--system` choice goes in `content/mod.rs`.
  - Sol is about seven times wider than Corvane: Neptune is about 2,700 render units out. Check the far clip (20,000 units, `view/camera/rig.rs`) at the system fit and at the pan limit.

## Fixes


## Other

- [ ] **Bring older docs up to the writing style**
  - The rules are in `docs/README.md` (Writing). Do it one doc at a time, with no change of meaning.
  - The longest are the likeliest to need it: `ideas/mechanics/requirements-and-bids.md`, `ideas/mechanics/component-stats.md` and `ideas/mechanics/transfers.md`.
- [ ] **Screenshot debug option**
  - A built-in way to capture the game window without editing `main.rs`: for example, an environment variable naming a view (frame body, distance, tilt, time rate) and an output path. The app sets that view, waits for it to settle, saves a screenshot and exits.
  - Keep it in a view debug module, read through the bindings or a debug resource, not in `main.rs`. Then replace the "temporarily edit `main.rs`" steps in CLAUDE.md ("Seeing the game").
